## Report an issue

Please follow the guidelines below when creating an issue so that your issue can be more promptly resolved:
* Provide information including: the version of PHP and This package, the type of operating system and Web server;
* Provide the complete error call stack if available;
* Describe the steps for reproducing the issue. It would be even better if you could provide code to reproduce the issue;

Do not report an issue if you are asking how to use some feature. You should use the `README.md` file.

Before you report an issue, please search through existing issues to see if your issue is already reported or fixed to make sure you are not reporting a duplicated issue. Also make sure you have the latest version of package and see if the issue still exists.
